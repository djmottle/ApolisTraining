This is an app that makes you input a username and password of at least 6 characters and then calls an API and displays a searchable list of movies with their popularity, rating, and poster.  If you click on the  cell, a new view controller showing the image of the movie and it's title shows up.  The application uses API calls and protocols to get and move data.
